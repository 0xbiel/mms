# MMS

## Minimal Management System written in Go.

This is a personal project to practice Go and to manage my consultancy jobs.

## Usage

`mms` is meant to be used locally. Just run `$ mms -s` and it will start running on `localhost:9000`. You can also specify a port using the `-p` argument followed by the port number.
