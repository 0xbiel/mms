# MMS

## Minimal Management System written in Go.

This is a personal project to practice Go and to manage my consultancy jobs.

![](./demo.mp4)

## Usage

`mms` is meant to be used locally. Just run `$ mms -s` and it will start running on `localhost:8080`. You can also specify a port using the `-s` argument followed by the port number.

1. `$ git clone git@github.com:0xbiel/mms`
2. `$ cd mms/src`
3. `$ ./mms -s`
